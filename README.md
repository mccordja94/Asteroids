# Asteroids
Asteroids game

Asteroids was created as the final project of CMPT 202 class. It is written entirely in java.  Creation involved writing different classes for the many different aspects of the games functionality. Perhaps the most challenging class to write was asteroid class as it took a while to tweak the logic to make the asteroids behave as one would imagine. There were also several bugs in the ship class that took a significant amount of time to fix. These included malfunctions with the ship detecting when it was inside the boundaries of an asteroid, shooting, and communicating a landed hit to other classes. The game is now fully functional and is ran from the game class.
